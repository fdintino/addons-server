Your add-on, {{ addon.name }} {{ addon.current_version.version }}, has been repackaged with a new version of the SDK. Repacks happen automatically for security and stability updates to the SDK. Your add-on should continue working without any further changes.

You can manage your new version ({{ new_version.version }}) here: {{ url('devhub.versions.edit', addon.slug, new_version.id)|absolutify }}

<li>After 14 days, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.</li>
<li>We will ask you to fill out a quick <strong>optional survey</strong> to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="leaving-the-study">Leaving the study</h2>

<h3 id="all-shield-studies">All Shield Studies</h3>
<p>Every Shield Study collects data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.</p>
<p>This data is associated with <a href="https://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/index.html">Firefox Telemetry collection</a>.</p>
<h3 id="this-particular-study">This Particular Study</h3>
<p>In addition to the data collected by all Shield Studies and your voluntary answers to the followup survey, here are the <strong>key things you should know</strong> about what is happening when you participate in this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>We collect basic usage data regarding your interaction with the experimental add-on, such as data when you use a new security feature.</li>
<li>We collect information about your visits to a few popular sites and if you have a saved login for that site. No login credentials will be tracked or saved.</li>
<li>As you would expect, we do not collect any information when you are in private browsing mode.</li>
</ul>
